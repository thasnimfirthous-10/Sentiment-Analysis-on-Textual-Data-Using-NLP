📌 TASK – 4

Task Title : Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

📖 PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Task-4 focuses on performing Sentiment Analysis on textual data such as reviews or user comments using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.
The objective of this project is to preprocess raw text data, convert it into numerical features, implement a classification model, and analyze sentiments as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
The dataset was loaded from a structured CSV file and examined for completeness and quality. Text preprocessing techniques were applied, including converting text to lowercase, removing special characters, and eliminating stopwords using the NLTK library.
The cleaned textual data was transformed into numerical format using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) method. A Logistic Regression classification model was trained to predict sentiment categories based on extracted features.
The model was evaluated using standard performance metrics to assess prediction accuracy and classification effectiveness.
